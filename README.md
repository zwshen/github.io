In this post, I'll be sharing my experience and skills as a software engineer and providing insights into the field of software engineering.

I am a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience working for Garmin international, a multinational technology company that specializes in GPS navigation, aviation, and wearable technology. I have held various roles at the company, including Advanced Software Engineer, Technical Team Leader, and my current role as an Embedded Software Engineer.

As an Embedded Software Engineer, I have been responsible for developing wearable products with embedded systems that operate on an RTOS. I have also implemented touch firmware using C/C++ that supports gesture recognition, improving the user experience of the products. To ensure timely delivery of software products, I have utilized Agile Software Process to manage software development.

In my previous role as a Technical Team Leader, I led a team of five engineers in developing 3D city map reconstruction and navigation software for embedded devices. Additionally, I designed and developed a 3D rendering engine, demonstrating my proficiency in software development.

My skills include proficiency in programming languages such as C/C++ and Python, as well as experience in using Agile Software Process to manage software development. I am skilled in developing embedded systems for wearable products and GIS software using C++, and I have demonstrated leadership skills in leading a technical team to develop 3D city map software for embedded devices.
